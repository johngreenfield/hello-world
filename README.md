# Hi, I'm John.

I'm a web developer, tech enthusiast and occasional writer.


HTML5 | CSS3 | Bootstrap | JavaScript | jQuery | PHP | WordPress | SEO

This is the source code for my site, which you are more than welcome to use all or part of in your own site. All I ask is you credit me somewhere for it.

It is a simple four section one page HTML doucment with a script to pull your articles from Medium and display them as responsive cards. No libraries or frameworks, just vanilla HTML5/CSS3/JS
